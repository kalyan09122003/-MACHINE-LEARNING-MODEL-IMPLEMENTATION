##  Project Overview

This project is a Python-based Jupter Notebook that detects whether a given SMS message is spam or ham (not spam). It uses Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data processing, modeling, and visualization. Text messages are converted into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer. The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to train and evaluate a Logistic Regression model. Model performance is measured using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix. Users can also enter custom SMS messages to check whether they are spam or ham.
